# IBM-Quantum-Summer-School-22
  The Qskit Gobal Summer School was a two-week long summer school based on quantum computing and simulations, especially chemical simulations. 
  
  I have added the labs I completed of the school in this repo.
  
  LABS:
  1. Lab 1 - Intro to circuit composition
  2. Lab 2 - Advanced circuits
  3. Lab 3 - Quantum Noise
  4. Lab 4 - Simulating a quantum spin -1/2 model
